# A big tooth cohort
We scanned a *big* bunch of teeth for a team of [the dental clinic of the University of Bern](https://www.zmk.unibe.ch/).
To get an overview of the samples *while* we scanned the whole tooth cohort we generated a [preview and analysis notebook](ToothAnalyis.ipynb).
We want to programmatically generate three-dimensional visualizations of the teeth with the [`itkwidgets`](https://github.com/InsightSoftwareConsortium/itkwidgets). For this we use the [display notebook](ToothDisplay.ipynb).
To be able to brag a bit about how much we scanned and to add to the discussion of the manuscript we whipped up a [datasize-bragging notebook](ToothDataSize.ipynb).
